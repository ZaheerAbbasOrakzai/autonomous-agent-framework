# Project 09 - Agent-as-a-service platform

Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Estimated time: 4-6 weeks
Status: spec

## Problem

A platform where users can deploy, discover, and invoke agents via A2A Agent Cards, with usage tracking, billing, and quality ratings. The platform is the "app store" for agents.

This project exercises A2A at scale, platform engineering, and the marketplace concepts from module 07. It is the most ambitious project in the catalog.

## Architecture

1. Web UI (Next.js): browse agents, view Agent Cards, deploy your own agent, view usage.
2. API server (FastAPI): serves the UI, handles authentication, proxies A2A calls.
3. Agent runtime (LangGraph Platform or self-hosted Docker): runs the deployed agents.
4. A2A gateway: serves Agent Cards at `/.well-known/agent.json`, routes A2A requests to the right agent.
5. Billing (Stripe): tracks usage, charges users.
6. Observability (LangSmith + custom dashboards): per-agent metrics, platform-level metrics.

## Stack

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: FastAPI
- Agent runtime: LangGraph Platform or Docker
- Database: Postgres
- Billing: Stripe
- Observability: LangSmith + Prometheus + Grafana
- A2A: the protocol layer

## Eval rubric

| Metric | Target | How measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Agent deployment time | under 5 minutes | From upload to live |
| A2A compliance | 100% | Deployed agents pass A2A spec test |
| Platform uptime | 99.5%+ | Monthly uptime |
| Cold-start latency | under 3s | For an idle agent |
| Per-agent cost tracking | 100% | All invocations attributed and billed |

## Datasets

- 5 sample agents to deploy (the projects 01-05 above are good candidates)
- Synthetic user traffic for load testing

## Stretch goals

- Agent marketplace (browse, rate, install agents)
- Agent composition (chain agents visually)
- Agent analytics (per-agent dashboards)
